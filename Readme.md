# Mini Projects

I am building small sizeable projects which will help me learn new things as well as stay on top of to dust off my coding skills.

## Projects

### Uptime Dashboard
A CLI tool to monitor website health and uptime intervals using a terminal user interface (TUI). It reads a YAML configuration file to spawn goroutines for each URL and tracks their status.

### Worker Pool Dashboard
A CLI dashboard to visualize a worker pool processing jobs from a SQLite database. It reads tasks from a JSON file, stores them in SQLite, and processes them using a concurrent worker pool, all while displaying real-time progress in a TUI.
